## Research Experience

### **Inflation Forecasting in India with Machine Learning and FX Reserves**  
*Advisor: Prof. Sanjiv Kumar*  
**May 2024 - Present**  
- Forecasted inflation in India using machine learning models and evaluated the impact of including foreign exchange reserves (FX reserves) as a determinant.  
- Extracted relevant variables such as interest rates, money supply, industrial production, and FX reserves from the CEIC database.  
- Implemented Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models alongside ARIMA and Multiple Regression for predictions.  
- Achieved RMSE of 0.69 (Random Forest) and 0.58 (Gradient Boosting), significantly outperforming ARIMA (RMSE: 24.95).  
- Inclusion of FX reserves improved accuracy, reducing RMSE by 5–10% across models.

### **Trade Relations of India and CPTPP Nations**  
*Advisor: Prof. Somesh Kumar Mathur*  
**Aug 2023 - Nov 2023**  
- Used the Structural Gravity Model to assess whether India should sign a trade agreement with CPTPP member countries.  
- Analyzed 2020 trade data from 11 CPTPP nations and five applicant countries, employing GE-PPML estimation.  
- Found negative relationships between trade costs (distance, tariffs) and import values, while GDP showed a positive correlation.
